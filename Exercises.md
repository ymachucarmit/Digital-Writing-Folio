### Questions

#### What types of writing do you do (i.e, fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)? 

I write fiction, in the form of short stories mostly. However I am also working on a novel length fiction piece. I also enjoy writing poetry, and have made a short poetry film before, and would love to continue to explore poetry in a visual format. I am also interested in screenplays and screenwriting. 


#### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

I use Word to write writing assignments and my longer novel length projects, to keep track of word counts and to make it easier to edit. I also use word for poems, as I find it is helpful in playing around with line breaks and the layout of the poem. 

I use a notebook and pen to dot point ideas and write drafts of short stories. 

I often listen to music when I write. 


#### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g, constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)? 

I find using Word very useful, as it is very easy to grab blocks/paragraphs of writing and move them around, or have a lot of information in the one document. However I do find the one document and having to scroll through multiple pages constricting. 

I also find writing on paper constricitng, as it is harder to edit than a word document.





## Week 2

### Questions

#### How is electronic literature different from print literature? 

Electronic literature is different from print literature as it requires technology to be actualised. Print literature doesn't need a laptop or the internet to be actualised necessarily. Electronic literature requires a very different reader experience, and requires the reader to interact with the piece for it to be completed and for the narrative to progress, as opposed to print literatue where the reader just has to hold the printed work and read it. Electronic literature also seems to be a lot more experimental than print literature. It is a much newer form of liteature in comparison to print liteature, and its conventions and techniques are evolving along with technology.  

#### What are some of the qualities of electronic literature? 

Some qualities of electronic literature are that majority of it is realised through code, such as Javascript or html. There are certain conventions, for example, 'Shade' is defined by vision, there always has to be a light source in order for the user to move around or for anything to exist, it has to be visible. The most prominent quality of electronic literature is that it requires the reader's interaction for the narrative to be completed or navigated through. 
Every piece has its own conventions and techniques.  


[Taroko Gorge Remix - Andrew Plotkin](https://nickm.com/taroko_gorge/argot_ogre_ok/)
#### What aspects of the remix are the same?

Both the original and this remix are continuous and never ending, and flow down the page line by line. They both have quite short lines as well.

#### What aspects of the remix are different? 

In this remix by Andrew Plotkin, it is split up into different stanza-like blocks, that are different colours, with black text on top. The stanzas are unrelated, and do not flow into each other. As the poem progresses and time passes, more stanza blocks appear; it starts off with one, then two appear, then three and so on. 

#### Is the remix successful (why or why not)? 

I think the original is more successful, as having the multiple blocks being unrelated makes it jarring, and doesn't let the story flow continuously like the original intended. The bright colours of the stnaza blocks also adds to the sense of the work being disjointed. The piece also appears to have code on the side running along with the continuous poem. The pace of the tet moving upwards is also too fast to read.
