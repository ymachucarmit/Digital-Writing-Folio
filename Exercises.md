### Questions

#### What types of writing do you do (i.e, fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)? 

I write fiction, in the form of short stories mostly. However I am also working on a novel length fiction piece. I also enjoy writing poetry, and have made a short poetry film before, and would love to continue to explore poetry in a visual format. I am also interested in screenplays and screenwriting. 


#### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

I use Word to write writing assignments and my longer novel length projects, to keep track of word counts and to make it easier to edit. I also use word for poems, as I find it is helpful in playing around with line breaks and the layout of the poem. 

I use a notebook and pen to dot point ideas and write drafts of short stories. 

I often listen to music when I write. 


#### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g, constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)? 

I find using Word very useful, as it is very easy to grab blocks/paragraphs of writing and move them around, or have a lot of information in the one document. However I do find the one document and having to scroll through multiple pages constricting. 

I also find writing on paper constricitng, as it is harder to edit than a word document.





## Week 2

### Questions

#### How is electronic literature different from print literature? 

Electronic literature is different from print literature as it requires technology to be actualised. Print literature doesn't need a laptop or the internet to be actualised necessarily. Electronic literature requires a very different reader experience, and requires the reader to interact with the piece for it to be completed and for the narrative to progress, as opposed to print literatue where the reader just has to hold the printed work and read it. Electronic literature also seems to be a lot more experimental than print literature. It is a much newer form of liteature in comparison to print liteature, and its conventions and techniques are evolving along with technology.  

#### What are some of the qualities of electronic literature? 

Some qualities of electronic literature are that majority of it is realised through code, such as Javascript or html. There are certain conventions, for example, 'Shade' is defined by vision, there always has to be a light source in order for the user to move around or for anything to exist, it has to be visible. The most prominent quality of electronic literature is that it requires the reader's interaction for the narrative to be completed or navigated through. 
Every piece has its own conventions and techniques.  


[Taroko Gorge Remix - Andrew Plotkin](https://nickm.com/taroko_gorge/argot_ogre_ok/)
#### What aspects of the remix are the same?

Both the original and this remix are continuous and never ending, and flow down the page line by line. They both have quite short lines as well.

#### What aspects of the remix are different? 

In this remix by Andrew Plotkin, it is split up into different stanza-like blocks, that are different colours, with black text on top. The stanzas are unrelated, and do not flow into each other. As the poem progresses and time passes, more stanza blocks appear; it starts off with one, then two appear, then three and so on. 

#### Is the remix successful (why or why not)? 

I think the original is more successful, as having the multiple blocks being unrelated makes it jarring, and doesn't let the story flow continuously like the original intended. The bright colours of the stnaza blocks also adds to the sense of the work being disjointed. The piece also appears to have code on the side running along with the continuous poem. The pace of the tet moving upwards is also too fast to read.

### Reflection on Twine exercise

#### Writing Hypertext Fiction

#### How is it different from fiction?

I would say hypertext fiction differs from fiction in that it requires a level of reader interactivity. When reading fiction, such as in the form of a novel, the only interactivity required from the reader is to hold the novel and turn the page. Hypertext fiction invloves clicking, as well in some cases choosing what to click. In this case the story or narrative direction is up to the reader, and what link they choose to click on.

#### How is it different from games?

The difference between hypertext fiction and games is that games have an objective, something to complete or achieve in order to finish the game or progress. Although hypertext fiction involves a level of intereacting that is similar to that of a video game, the only objective is to read the work until the story finishes itself. There is no goal or objective for the reader to reach. The difference is also that hypertext fiction interaction involves a reader, game interaction involves a player.

#### How do you plan fiction?

I personally like to write very brief dot points down, either on paper or in a Word document that show a rough idea of the linear events that will occur. 

#### How could you plan hypertext fiction?

I think planning hypertext fiction would be a lot harder than planning fiction. I imagine you could possibly draw a family-tree looking plan, to show where you would want the story to branch off, and to see what part of the story connects to where. You could also see where you want the reader to click and link to this way. Using something similar to a flow chart could also work, using arrows to point where the narrative is going. 

#### Reflection on using Twine
I found using Twine the easiest to use out of the other softwares we have experimented with so far as a class. I enjoyed the simplicity of just writing the story in without having to code it. However I did struggle to experiment much further than adding multiple passages and links. I wasn't able to add an image and get it to appear in the correct format. I like the simplicity of Twine from a reader perspective as well, as it is not too complicated to navigate through a story.
