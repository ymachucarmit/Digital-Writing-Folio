### Questions

#### What types of writing do you do (i.e, fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)? 

I write fiction, in the form of short stories mostly. However I am also working on a novel length fiction piece. I also enjoy writing poetry, and have made a short poetry film before, and would love to continue to explore poetry in a visual format. I am also interested in screenplays and screenwriting. 


#### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

I use Word to write writing assignments and my longer novel length projects, to keep track of word counts and to make it easier to edit. I also use word for poems, as I find it is helpful in playing around with line breaks and the layout of the poem. 

I use a notebook and pen to dot point ideas and write drafts of short stories. 

I often listen to music when I write. 


#### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g, constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)? 

I find using Word very useful, as it is very easy to grab blocks/paragraphs of writing and move them around, or have a lot of information in the one document. However I do find the one document and having to scroll through multiple pages constricting. 

I also find writing on paper constricitng, as it is harder to edit than a word document.
